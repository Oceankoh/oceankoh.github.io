title: Everyday Theory

### Intro

Everyday Theory is the study of theories that we as individuals form in an attempt to explain the things happening around us on a daily basis and more importantly what those theories say about us. At least, that is my attempt at defining it. Not much comes up on google when you search for "Everyday Theory", and the one book that seems to discuss this idea costs >$100. So perhaps I'll have a part 2 of this post after visiting the library. But for now, this is what I've gathered so far. (Actually, since I'm pretty new to this myself, this could also be considered my theory on Everyday Theory)

### Our role as Theorist

When I see the word "theory", I tend to think of scientific theories. And therefore, a theorist to me would be some highly educated professional who has dedicated years of their life to academia. There is an inclination (at least for me) to think that to be a theorist, you need to be well versed in the subject matter. But that's not the case. I mean... conspiracy theorist are theorist as well. So, anyone can be a theorist. In fact, everyone is. 

Every day, we see new things, and we formulate theories to explain them. Simple things like when you notice a platoon mate constantly reporting sick. You theorise that he's trying to chao keng. These are all theories that we form, and more often than not, they remain as theories, never getting confirmed as a fact. 

### Why is this important

They say it's the details that matter. We see it in shows where the detective uses the most obscure details in a person's behavior to determine whether they're guilty. Whilst the examples in these shows are often exaggerated for dramatic effect, it shows how our past experiences is reflected in our thoughts and actions. By analysing the everyday theories that we formulate, one might be able to learn more about an individual. With the same example as before, another possible theory for your platoon mate reporting sick could be that he has a weak immune system. Depending on which theory you chose, it may suggest things about your NS experience thus far. 

In essence, if we study the everyday theories constructed by different people, it may reveal the social context in which they lived in and perhaps help us answer the problems that brought about these theories in the first place.
