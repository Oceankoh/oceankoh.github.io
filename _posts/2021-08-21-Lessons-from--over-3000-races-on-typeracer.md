title: Lessons from over 3000 races on typeracer
---

### Intro

As of the time of this writing, I have 3275 races recorded on typeracer. I too think it's excessive. You might even call it an addiction...

### Lesson 1: Numbers aren't everything

In the intro I said I have 3275 races recorded, which is true, but it doesn't mean I have only played 3275 races. Those 3275 races don't include those that I abort halfway or right before finishing because I didn't want a lousy wpm to be recorded. They don't inlcude races I've plyaed when I wasn't signed in. They don't include the practice races I played on the same text. Though I can't be sure of how many races I've actually played, That number is at least double what I've recorded. 

Numbers can lie.

### Lesson 2: Progress is slow

My average wpm over the last 10 races often lies in the 90s. But overall, it's still in the 70s. I've progressed a lot since the time I was typing 40+ wpm but it was really slow progress. A 50 wpm improvement over roughly 5 years. 10wpm/year, 0.027/day, 0.015/race recorded. I doubt anyone would notice such a small improvement on a daily basis, but it accumulates. 

### Lesson 3: Winning isn't everything

Winning races in typeracer is mostly based on luck. Typeracer's player matching system is unfair. I suspect they look at your short-term average wpm, which may seem fair, but it fails to consider many factors. If I typed a few nice easy texts in a row, I would most certainly end up competing against players above my level. The races where I've gotten my personal bests are often races which I lose. As such, getting first in typeracer is almost meaningless to me. As cliche as it sounds, I'm more focused on competitng against myself, increasing my typing accuracy while maintaining a good speed. A good race always brings me satisfaction regardless of outcome. 

### Lesson 4: 1 step backward but 2 steps forward

Touch typing isn't natural. Only an exprienced typer can utilise all 10 fingers efficiently. Someone typing for the first time is likely to use 2 fingers, and question why the qwerty layout is as such. I too started typing with 2 fingers. As I got faster, I used 4, then 6. I learnt use the shift key instead of capslock. Then I learnt to use my thumb for the spacebar. After I felt pretty good, I took the big leap and decided not to look at my keyboard while typing. Each time I changed my typing style, I had to unlearn what I had committed to muscle memory. This requires active awareness of what I'm doing with my fingers, which undoubtledly slowed my down. But it didn't take very long to get back up to speed since slow as hell to begin with.   

My biggest slow down was when I decided to learn touch typing. I still remember I was averaged in the high 70s and sometimes hit 80+ wpm. I knew I could get faster with practice, but I also knew the improvements weren't significant. And so I decided to relearn typing. My WPM got halved as I was relearning how to type. It was a mental struggle. My index finger would instinctively reach for the letter E, but just before I press it, I remember that my middle finger should be there instead. And so I repositioned my hands and tried again. It took me a couple months before I was comfortably hitting 70. And thanks to that, I can hit the 100s pretty often today.

### Lesson 5: Don't compare

This was the lesson that inspired this post. I realised this while competing against a friend. Though my average wpm was faster all but one of his races, I lost several times, all due to the same reason. It always happens as follows.

1. I make a mistake
2. I see his avatar inching closer to mine
3. I get stressed
4. I keep looking at how close he is to me
5. I make more mistakes
6. I lose

I lost the mental game against myself. My attention was diverted causing me to mess up more. If I focused solely on my performance, I would've likely done better. Of course, performing under stress is a skill, but not getting stressed in the first place is also a skill.
