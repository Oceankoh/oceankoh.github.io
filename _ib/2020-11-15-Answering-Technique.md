### Compilation of model answers from past year papers

The following document is a compilation of the suggested answers to question from past year IB papers. I compiled this because I was annoyed at how I kept losing marks simply because my answer, although correct, was not what they wanted. So I just decided to study the mark scheme, since I was confident in my understanding. 

I believe in learning through application, especially for computer science. As seen from other parts of this website, I have various projects and participate in competitions which help to supplement my learning and reinforce my understanding of the subject. If you don't understand the subject in the first place, memorising the mark scheme is not gonna help you much.
