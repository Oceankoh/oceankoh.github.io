## Topic 5: Electricity and Magnetism
### Definitions

|Term|Definition|
|:---|:---|
|Coulomb's Law|Electrostatic force between 2 point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them|

In a system of 2 *spherical* charges,
* Each charge must feel a force of the same size as the force on the other charge
* $F=\frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}=\frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}$
* Notice that the columb constant $k=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$ is basically for spheres

Based on definition for electric field strength, 
* $E=\frac{F}{q_{t}}$ where $q_t$ is the charge experience the force by the field
* $E=\frac{q_f}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}$ where $q_f$ is the charge producing the field

Electric potential energy
* Energy = Force*Distance
* $E_p=Fd=\frac{kQq}{r}$
* Electric potential energy is the amount of work done to bring a charge to that point in that field
* Hence releasing a charge from that point in the field would mean the $E_p$ would convert to kinetic energy

## Topic 9: Simple Harmonic Motion
### Definitions

|Term|Definition|
|:---|:---|
|Resolution|The minimum distance between distinguishable objects in an image|
|Rayleigh Criterion|2 sources are just resolvable when the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of one of the sourcse falls on the central maximum of the diffraction pattern if the other source|
|Resolvance|Resolvance for a grating is the ratio of the wavelength of light to the smallest difference in wavelength that can be resolved by the grating|
|Doppler Effect|Change in measured frequency due to relative motion of source and observer|

### Phase Difference

Particles moving in the same direction all the time are in phase.
It is possible to vibrate in phase but with difference amplitudes.  
So basically, in a single wave, all nodes in 1 half of a wave are in phase.

### Nodes and Anti-nodes

**Nodes** are points along a medium in a standing wave that appear to be standing still. These points undergo no displacement.  
**Antinodes** are points in the medium that undergo maximum displacement during each vibration cycle.  

### Double Slit interference

$n\lambda=d\sin\theta$
- n is the order
- Central maxima is the 0th order
- $\theta$ is the angle from the center to the m-th order of constructive interference
- $d$ is the slit spacing

### Single slit diffraction

$b\sin\theta=m\lambda$
- Similar equation to the double slit interference ($d\sin\theta=m\lambda$) equation to find maximas, but in single slit it finds the minimas
- $\theta$ is the angle from the center to the minimum, this means that the central maximum width is $2\theta$
- b is the slit width

$\theta = \frac{\lambda}{b}$
- Equation is derived from above, but used only for the central maximum, hence $m=1\ or\  -1$
- The $\sin$ disappears because of the small angle. The sine of a small angle is approximately the angle.
- b is the slit width

### Diffraction Gratings

Nothing much to this, just an application of the above formulas but this time over many slits. 

Visually, using a diffraction grating makes the maxima narrower and more intense because
1. More slits means more light passes through
2. More waves interfere with each other, the intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude
3. Narrower because of more destructive interference

### Thin-film interference 

Light waves change phase by $\pi$ or $180^{\circ}$ when reflecting off a medium with higher refractive index (E.g. light from air to glass will change phase, but glass to air will not). 

### Resolvance stuff

Circular Aperature: $\theta = 1.22\frac{\lambda}{b}$  
- Theta is the minimum angle that 2 objects can be resolved
- Rayleigh Criterion

## Topic 10: Fields 
### Definitions

|Term|Definition|
|:---|:---|
|Equipotential Surfaces|Regions where the potential is the same|
|Gravitational Potential Energy|Work done by an external force in bringing a small test mass from infinity to that point|
|Gravitational Potential| Work done per unit mass by an external force in bringing a small test mass from infinity to that point|
|Electric Field Strength|Force per unit charge acting on a positive test charge|
|Electric Potential Energy|Work done in moving a small positive test charge from infinity to that point|
|Electric Potential|Work done per unit charge in moving a small positive test charge from infinity to that point|

Gravitational Field Strength or Gravity / Electric Field Strength [Units: $Nkg^{-1}$ or $NC^{-1}$]
- $g =\frac{F}{m} =\frac{GM}{r^2}=-\frac{\Delta V_g}{\Delta r}$
- $E=\frac{F}{q} = \frac{KQ}{r^2} = \frac{\Delta V_e}{\Delta r}$

Force or Gravitational Force / Electric Force [Units: $N$]
- weight = mass*gravity
- $F=mg=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$ / $F=Eq=\frac{kQq}{r^2}$

Gravitational Potential Energy / Electric Potential Energy [Units: $J$] 
- Energy = Work done = Force*Distance
- $E_p=Fd=-\frac{GMm}{r}$ / $E_p=Fd=-\frac{kQq}{r}$

Gravitational Potential / Electric Potential or Voltage (Potential difference) [Units: $Jkg^{-1}$ or $JC^{-1} / V$]
- Potential (Energy per unit mass/charge) vs Potential Energy
- Alternatively, $V = \frac{W}{m}\ or\ \frac{W}{q} = \frac{Fd}{m} = \frac{Fd}{q}$
- Hence $V_g=\frac{E_p}{m} = \frac{Fd}{m} =-\frac{GM}{r}$ / $V_e=\frac{E_p}{q}=\frac{Fd}{q}=\frac{kQ}{r}$

### Difference between gravitational and electrical fields

- Gavitational Fields are only attractive whereas Electric fields are attractive/repulsive

### Important conceptual shit

- Potential is a scalar quantity. When there is more than 1 mass or charge, potential at a point is the sum of individual potentials
- Inside a charged sphere, potential is the same everywhere. Hence potential gradient is 0, which means field strength is 0.
- Columnb constant is for spherical charges. For charged parallel plates, use $\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta d}=\frac{V}{d}$ instead of $\frac{kQq}{r}$

### Quantum vs Relativistic behaviors

Quantum Equations and it's relativistic counterparts

### Photoelectric effect and stopping potential experiment

Things to note:
- Work function is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from a solid 
- **Maximum** kinetic energy $E=hf-\phi$ is dependent on frequency of light
- Not all electrons have the same kinetic energy as the bond energy may be different. Workfunction is the minimum and a constant for all electrons.
- Number of electrons is proportional to intensity of the light.
- Intensity does not affect kinetic energy. This supports the explanation that light behaves as particles since the energy of a single particle is transferred to the electron. 

Predictions of classical model that do not hold:
- Light as a electromagnetic wave interacts with the electron by exerting a force. Therefore, a threshold intensity is required to free an electron. However, evidence shows a threshold frequency instead.
- If light behaves as a wave, resonance might help free the electron (light at the natural frequency of the electron would be more significant). However, evidence shows light of any frequency above the threshold frequency would free an electron.
 
### Uncertainty Bullshit

Position and Momentum cannot be measured precisely at the same time.  
Uncertainty in position is in metres since momentum is also 1-dimensional.    
For most questions, 
- Size of whatever the thing is discussing is most likely the uncertainty in position.
- In momentum, mass is most likely known, so velocity is the one that is uncertain

If uncertainty in position exceeds the space in which the particle is confined to, the transmission of the particle through the energy barrier is known as quantum tunneling

- Eyepiece forms virutal magnified image
- Normal adjustment means final image is form at the near point so that maximum angular magnification is obtained
- Magnification in normal adjustment: $\frac{h_i}{h_0}$

- Objective forms a real diminished image
- Eyepiece forms a virtual magnified image

### Fibre Optics

### Parts of an X-ray

### Ultrasound Process

- Alternating current is applied to a piezoelectric cystal
- Piezoelectric crystal vibrates producing ultrasound waves (Ultrasound transducer emmits waves)
- Alternating current is turned off
- Ultrasound waves are reflected at the boundaries between fluid and soft tissue or tissue and bone
- The ultrasound waves vibrate the piezoelectric crystal producing a alternating current
- The time taken for these reflections can be used to calculate where the boundaries are located
- Information is presented in either an A-scan (amplitude-modulated scan) or B-scan (brightness-modulated scan)
- A-scan is useful to find out where the internal organs are and take a precise measurement of distance
- B-scan can be used to form a 2D image by taking several B-scans at a time

### NMR Process

- When molecules are placed in a strong magnetic field, the spins of the nuclei are aligned to the field
- A gradient field is applied which aligns the spin of the nuclei in a particular precession (this allows us to determine the postition where the radiation is emitted)
- A pulse of radio waves at the larmor frequency is applied which causes the nuclei to undergo a spin transition
- After the pulse, the nucei return to their lower energy state by emitting radio waves
- The time over which radio waves are emitted is called the relaxation time
- The radio waves emitted are received by the RF receiver and is used to produce image scan
- The relaxation times depend on the type of tissue where radiation is emitted

##### Gradient field wizardry

Using 3 intersecting gradient fields, x y z, I can create a 3-dimensional gradient field.
This is basically like a coordinate system. When used to align the nuclei, the alignment (precession) would tell us the position.
This way it's possible to produce a 3-dimensional image.
