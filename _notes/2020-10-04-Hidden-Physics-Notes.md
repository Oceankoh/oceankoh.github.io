## Topic 1: Measurements
### Definitions

|Term|Definition|
|:---|:---|
|Physical Quantities|Measurable quantities consisting of magnitude and a unit|
|Random Errors|Unpredictable deviations of a measured value from the actual value, with equal chance of falling above or below the actual value|
|Systematic Errors|Errors that occur according to some fixed rules and yield consistent over or under estimation of the true value|

### Base SI Units

|Quantity|Symbol                                                               |
|:---|:---|
|Length|`m` (meter)|
|Time|`s` (second)|
|Mass|`kg` (kilogram)|
|Electric Current|`A` (ampere)|
|Temperature|`K` (Kelvin)|
|Amount of substance|`mol` (mole)|
|Luminous intensity| `cd` (candela)|


## Topic 2: Mechanics
### Definitions

|Term|Definition|
|:---|:---|
|Terminal Velocity|Refers to the constant velocity reached by a falling object when drag force is equal in magnitude to the force that is accelerating the object|
|Drag Force|Retarding force due to air resistance|
|Friction|Force that opposes the relative motion of two surfaces|
|Efficiency|Ratio of useful energy output to total energy output|
|Impulse|Change in momentum caused by a force|
|Elastic Collision|Conserves both momentum and kinetic energy|
|Inelastic collision|Conserves momentum and kinetic energy|
|Newton's first law of motion|An object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will continue in motion at constant speed in a straight line in the absence of a net force acting on it|
|Netwon's second law of motion|The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the netforce acting on it and takes place in the direction of the force|
|Newton's third law of motion|When 2 bodies A and B interact, theforce that A exerts on B is equaland opposite to the force that B exerts on A|
|Principle of conservation of Energy|Energy cannot be created or destroyed but may be converted from one form to another but the total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant|
|Conservation of Momentum|Total momentum of a closed system is constant provided no external resultant force acts on it|


## Topic 3: Thermal Physics
### Definitions

|Term|Definition|
|:---|:---|
|Boyle's Law|For a gas at a constant temperature the volume and pressure are inversely proportional|
|Charles' Law|If the mass and presure of a gas are constant, the volume is directly proportional to its aboslute temperature|
|Avogadro's constant|Number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12|
|Internal Energy|Sum of the potential energy and random kinetic energy of all the particles in a substance|
|Properties of an ideal gas|An ideal gas consists of a large number of identical molecules. The volume occupied by the molecules themselves is negligible compared to the volume occupied by the gas. The molecules obey Newton's laws of motion, and they move in random motion|
|Ideal Gas|A gas with no intermolecular force that obeys the ideal gas law, pV = nRT at all temperatures, pressures and volumes|
|Temperature|A measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance|
